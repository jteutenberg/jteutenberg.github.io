= Vitruvius Pollio: Houses =

Roman houses in towns were homes, shops, and offices all in one.

Rooms at the road side could be shop fronts with workers selling or making goods. Business visitors could walk through an entrance between these shops and enter the cavaedium -- an large room with an pool in the middle and an open roof above it. In the cavaedium visitors could discuss business with the owner.

Looking past the cavaedium a visitor would see another room that was a hall leading to the open back of the house. This hall was also the office for the owner with an are to work on the paperwork for the business and household.

Other rooms like dining rooms were behind doors to the left and right of the cavaedium.

Out the back, past the office, were gardens, kitchens and other rooms for servants and workers.

== Book VI: Building Recommendations

Put picture of floor plan here. 

== Chapter 2: Symmetry and Modifying the Rules ==

The "rules" on dimensions and art in later chapters are just recommendations. Vitruvius makes it clear that proportions should be changed to fit the building's surroundings. All that really matters is that the result is beautiful to the eye.

== Chapter 3: Proportions == 

This is the main chapter on house design. It gives many rules for the shapes and relative sizes of rooms within a house.

One of the first things to consider is how much land is available. Keep this in mind when deciding how large the rooms need to be.

=== Cavaedium ===

The design of the Roman house begins with the most used room: the cavaedium.

Vitruvius gives five different styles to choose from: Tuscan, Corinthian, tetrastyle, displuviate, and testudinate.
